# 3tg-off-the-shelf
A Game Jam projected made in University of Hull's Three Thing Game (3TG) developed with Stephan Zaneboni & Danny Wilde
This is a small game in which you have to hit pies escaping from the fridge with a bat that swung to the beat of a song that played in the background.
I was a programmer on the project along with Danny.
